        Once upon a time, the Tortoise and the Hare decided to have a race. The
        Hare, being fast, was confident he would win, while the Tortoise, slow
        and steady, believed he could still finish the race.
      </p>
      <p>
        The race started, and the Hare sprinted ahead, quickly leaving the
        Tortoise far behind. Confident in his lead, the Hare took a nap.
        Meanwhile, the Tortoise kept moving at a slow and steady pace.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the time the Hare woke up, the Tortoise had already crossed the
        finish line and won the race!
